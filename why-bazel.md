- Highlight the importance of a scalable, efficient build system in modern software development

---

# Comparison of Bazel with Other Build Systems

- Discuss the limitations of traditional build systems like Make, Ant, and Gradle
    - Show examples of complex build files and explain how they can be difficult to understand and maintain
    - Explain how these systems can struggle with scaling to large codebases
- Highlight the strengths and advantages of Bazel over other build systems
    - Discuss Bazel's scalability, determinism, multi-language and multi-platform support, and extensibility
    - Provide examples of companies that have switched to Bazel from other build systems and the benefits they've seen as a result

---

# Bazel Basics

- Explain what Bazel is and what it's used for
    - Show examples of the types of projects that Bazel is suited for
- Introduce the Bazel command-line interface and the BUILD file format
    - Provide examples of basic BUILD files and explain how they define targets and dependencies
    - Show how to use the `bazel` command-line tool to build and test a simple project
