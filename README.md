# Talks collection

This is a collection of some of the talks I've been giving:

- bazel-platforms: how platforms and toolchains work and how you can use them to run cross-builds and cross-tests targetting multiple platforms
- why-bazel: a short intro to Bazel, you can see the recording [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW8b-cgqicc)
